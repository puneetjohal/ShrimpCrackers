## Project Overview
Climate Crackers is a data visualization website that allows users to explore trends in climate change in the U.S. Our landing page will be a map of the U.S. showing the percent change of the average temperatures from previous years using a color gradient. Users will be able to pick a season and year. Users will also be able to input a location (city or town name) to search for the corresponding climate data, like average temperatures and days of precipitation for each year in the past century. If the user is signed in, they will be able to save these locations onto their watchlist.
